not everything is an issue where there is a right or wrong
well it is a solgryn game :P
odds are fast food would find a way to get it regulated so the average joe couldn't get it
well more in the united states, I feel fast food would be able to pay off the right people to make it so it doesn't affect them much
200 and immortality sound just awful to me
granted the prospect of living to 60+ bothers me
You are a wise old owl, owl
but jack the higher our population the higher our tech output and then we can win a science victory easier OpieOP

I R dum can't talk about this
Is there any game you would love to see remade?
Personally I look forward to my end. Then I don't have to deal with all the mental anguish of living but it'll come when it comes. People fear the inevitable too much. Just sit back and enjoy the ride

I feel the worst thing with gaming right now is that feeling "Gamey" is a bad thing. This growing need for video games to be a cinematic experience is taking away from challenge and turning games in to linear pathways with few deviations, there is little path for people to come up with their own play styles. you would not see a game like the old Deus Ex made now of days because it would be deemed too hard and the casual player would not be able to approach it. I have no issue with story being a focus in gaming but not when it comes at a cost to game play. I understand that this is an issue that is mainly caused by â€œtriple-Aâ€? companies and there are indy devs that are doing good work on keeping games games but there has to be a breaking point when the games that get all the big publicity are getting to be as bad a shovelware. I feel at the direction the big companies are going there is a good chance that there will be another gaming industry crash like we had in the 80â€™s.
That said I would love to see a return of turn based rpgs :)
I think if the games where worth buying to begin with then buying dlc would not be as much as an issue. Nothing wrong with expansion packs :)
like the old quarter eater arcade machines?
I miss Dave Thomas. his commercials where the best
Speaking of genres that are pissing me off. Enough with the damn action RPGs. They all play the fucking same and are way too grim dark. What is wrong with being the different studio that makes a game that doesn't take it's game too serious? Too many games are all dark and serious and they all look the same and we are running out of shades of brown to color all their games at this point.

I think you'd like Xcom Lucas
I need to play the original

LIES!
she is Anne
that is an odd name
though her name is Anne "Chat" Lurking in my xcom run
you are my #3
behind boombati and warwitch
no. That is boombati. he is my mech and he just tears aliens apart

I feel it needlessly complicates the game
that is true but I feel the original x-com is fine in complication but just needed to be a longer
Have a good nap anne

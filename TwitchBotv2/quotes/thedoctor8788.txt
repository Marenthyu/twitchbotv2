The jokes that run amongst IT. :P
It's sad, but so true.
Never have I seen an Englishman freak out about the French as you have right now Lucas. :P

It would be nice to be bilingual, but it's not high on my priority list. I'm already starting to invest time into learning programming languages, so I don't need to add actually spoken/written languages ontop of that. lol

I wouldn't mind learning German. That's where a good portion of my ancestry comes from.
Heya Marenthyu, jackTHULU

Thank you for the cast Jack, though I was only here for the end of it. jackTHULU

Take care Anne! pmgHUG
Hiya Marenthyu. jackTHULU
How are you tonight?
That sounds fun. :D
I took today off. Had a funeral to go to for a close friend/distant relative.
He was. He lived a long life so it's all good.
And thank you for the condolences Marenthyu.
It's all good. :D
Poor Zee. :P

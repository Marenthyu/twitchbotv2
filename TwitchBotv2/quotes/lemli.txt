People hate on skylanders way too much. I would've done anything to get those as a kid. And the games are decent AFAIK

How much is your completion % Jacklifear?

Most annoyed by a kid I've been was when my little sister kept watching Monsters Inc. over and over. We had to hide the tape/dvd
Seeing that movie 3-4 times a day was not pleasant.
Also, teletubbies. Fuck teletubbies.
Yeah, teletubbies were horrible because in an episode, they do the whole "again! again!" thing and basically each story repeats once in the episode already
so every time you watch it you see everything twice

What. That is hilarious.

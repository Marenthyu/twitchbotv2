I HAVE COFFEE!!!!
Fancy coffee shop coffee is...
Maren stop! Nobody likes Ranked League Players! They are all assholes!
First day of classes, lunch break! A little bit all over the place and jittery today
No
Excitement
I am in love with the semester
Also, you generally get more gold when you hit the minions worth more. :D
Because you lack vision. On that side, you should have wards on dragon and in tri bush :/
You'd be surprised how many people do. I have heard so many complaints from adcs that ask me to support because they hate random supports >.>
I'm super excited for my next class...... Like... I can't even keep calm
If the lane is gone, clear pink wards
They just made a new pair of alligator skin shoes
Another tip, it's better gold wise to get t2 gold income and buy wards the first back as a support, then go sitestone.
I just realized, they have the piltovers finest buff against Vi.

Sorry, typing and eating should not be a thing
Love the lyrical values in this song
Last concert I went to was Lorde
But seeing Lindsey live would also be a dream
Wanna buy me a ticket?
Only concerts in my area are 70 dollars minimum
Yeah, for you in my area, 62
For the cheap stuff
My leaguu updated! Can play after class a few games noa! :D

Mod version, lazy level

Master of tides
So.... Lord dances funny
But she sings straight to the teenage heart
Maren, what server?

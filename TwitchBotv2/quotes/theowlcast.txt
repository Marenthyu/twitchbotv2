"We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because,
according to Malthusian Dawinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living."

Its way too difficult to address the topic in chat.
3d printers
I get very emotional on the topic since I've been studying this for about 5 years. other methods of conducting society. The idea that the market system brings some kinda equilibrium of earthly resources.
is ridiculous.
Our entire system, in an economic sense is based on restriction, Scarcity and inefficiency are the movers of money, the more there is of any resource the less you can charge for it. The more problems there are, the more oppotunities there are to make money. Efficiency, abundance and sustainability are the enemies of our economic structure, for they are inverse to the mechanics required to perpetuate consumption.
Well, that is profoundly critical to understand, for once you put that together you begin to see that the one billion people currently starving on this planet, the endless slums of the poor and all the horrors of culture due to poverty and pravity, are not natural phenomenon due to some natural human order of lack of earthly resource. They are products of the creation, perpetuation and preservation of artificially scarcity and inefficiency.
Yeah. We should change the topic danDumb
That would be fun hootLove
So, are there any visual customization you can do to your character?

Oh, and I doubt robots are gonna become sentient and take over. There would be no use for such machines. Japan isnt actually as technologically advanced as it seems. most people dont own or use ever use PC's

Thats probably true. There society makes them antisocial or well socially awkward having no time ever to socialize. Relationship bots would be accepted right away. danDumb
There are already realistic dolls that men dress up and come home to and cook for or there are virtual gf's or virtual bf's

*Takes out a cross bow* HIJACK!
Yeah, I was going to start with a con, because of the whole DLC shit
I also hate the crate system a lot of the games that valve makes these days
I don't think anyone is going to talk about the subject at hand
I don't see the problem of needing to pay attention to the game, because you want to put your attention to the video game so you aren't bored
SO close!
I feel that the gaming industry is taking a turn for the worse because now it feels like it's become only for the money. The games themselves feel like they are becoming lack-luster because like Ludwig says, they feel they need to focus too much on the story rather then the game mechanic. While at the same time, I feel Skylanders is the opposite on the spectrum because they try to focus on the gimmick of making toys that you need to buy for the video game to make them fun. The game becomes more fun as you buy more toys, but the story kind of sucks balls.
I don't hate skylanders, if anything I love the figures, just the story kind of feels subpar, and the announcer voice is annoying as hell
Actually, I just wanted to use streaming to meet people and make them entertained. I don't need the money because I have SSI. I failed at streaming because hardly anyone ever shown up and those who did didn't stay around.
Hello BOB!
XD

I have an idea!
WOO! Progress!
TO BE CONTINUED'S!

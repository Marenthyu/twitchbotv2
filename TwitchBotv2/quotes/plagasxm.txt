Okay, the games of my youth..
I was raised on the NES originally, with SMB 1/2/3, Castlevania 2/3 (yes, I played the horror that is Simon's Quest when I was 3), Legacy of the Wizard, Duck Hunt, and Battletoads.As far as PC goes, Commander Keen 4, a few Mickey Mouse Teaches games which made me the smart guy I am today, and a slot machine game (which may explain my minor gambling addiction)
Skipped into Genesis from there, with the Sonic series and a SEGA CHANNEL! Ah, the many hours spent loving that. Seriously, ToeJam & Earl Kreygasm
And finally, I had a classic GameBoy back in the day, with Tetris and the original Pokemon games :)
Since I was 2 citlee :) Gotta love having a computer-savvy dad, haha
Oh, I forgot, when I had the Genesis I also had the 32X attachment, so I got to enjoy Knuckles Chaotix and Tempo :P
Ooh, full-progression list time? :D Okay, sec
Console: NES, Genesis, N64, GC, PS2, XBox, Wii, XBox360
Handheld: GB, GBC, GBA, DS, 3DS

Hi Jack and chat, Hope all are well
I would say one thing that would make twitch a better place is better care of those smallish streams, i know twitch has got to prioritise large streams but it is something they could work on. Also twitch is always is always growing and changing. Lastly i think having the communities of twitch keep trying to become one large community with small parts to it. rather than mutliple disconnected communitines. Sorry for huge post
Always a pleasure to be around jack
Get the much needed rest Jack. Was glad i had time to pop in catch you live

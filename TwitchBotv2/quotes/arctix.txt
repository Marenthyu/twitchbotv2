What's the word FuturemanGaming?
Tell that NERF system I said bring it girl
Yeah FuturemanGaming. I'm playing it on it's hardest difficulty, which is absolutely unnecessary.  I spent 9 hours on a boss and finally beat it. Sometimes you need to walk away with a fresh mind.
Hey you Anne! <3
Yeah, what's worse is that I had to beat it twice lmao! :P But absolutely FuturemanGaming. You should pick this one up. It's hella fun.
The dev is in chat. Solgryn. Great guy.
